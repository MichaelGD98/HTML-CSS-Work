        <h2>The Composition of Salt Water</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in saltwater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from 
            organisms. The most important components if seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases, nutrients, and pH.
            These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.
